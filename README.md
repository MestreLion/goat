Usage
-----

***Import:***

Decompress the pre-built library in `games/library/library.tar.bz2` to `~/.local/share/goat/library`

- You can also manually rebuild the library using the games in `games/sources`, a collection of nearly 280 thousand games in SGF format. Out of those, around 30 thousand games meet the default criteria for goat analysis:

		./run.py import games/sources --games 30000

The library itself takes 57MB of disk space, and the import will take around 1h40m. This will also pre-render the games' boards and save them to `~/.local/share/goat/boards`. This takes around **3.6GB** of disk space!

***Analysis***

	./run.py compute [--games NUM]

This will run the full analysis suite. It will store data in `~/.local/share/goat/hooks`. Use the optional `--games` to limit the number of games processed. Computing the whole library takes around 30 minutes.

***Display***

	./run.py display

Generate charts on data generated by a previous run of `compute`. This takes less than a minute once library is pre-computed.

***Results***

Results from all steps, import, compute and display, are saved to `~/goat`. Each run creates a new subfolder with a timestamp to store the results of that run. Charts are saved in PNG, SVG and EPS format, and data for auditing purposes are saved in JSON format.
